# Web API Quiz Challenge

## Description
This challenge requires a deployed password generator that generates a new, secure password when a "Generate Password" button is clicked. The user is to be presented with a series of prompts for the password criteria. The user will select the presented criteria that will be included in the password. The length of the password will be required to be at least eight (8) characters in length, but no more than 128 characters in length. The character types to include in the generated password will include lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. The user will be required to answer each prompt asking what to include in the password, and each input validated after each is selected. After each type of character is selected, a password will be generated that matches the selected criteria from the prompt answers. The password will either be displayed in an alert or written to the page. Shown here is a basic mock-up.
