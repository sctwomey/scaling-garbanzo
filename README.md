# Web API Quiz Challenge

## Description
This challenge requires a deployed timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. There must be a start button that when a user clicks it, starts a timer and presents a question. When the question is answered, the user is presented with another question. If a question is answered incorrectly time is decremented from the clock displayed on the webpage. When all of the questions are answered, or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. Once the game ends, a user can save the user's initials and high score. Shown here is a basic mock-up of the quiz and how it functions.
